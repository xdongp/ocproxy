.SH NAME
ocproxy \- lwip based proxy for openconnect
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ocproxy
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B ocproxy
command.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics,
.\" respectively.
\fBocproxy\fP is a program that provides a SOCKS and port-forwarding
proxy when used in conjunction with
.BR openconnect (1).
When using ocproxy, OpenConnect only
handles network activity that the user specifically asks to proxy, so the VPN
tunnel no longer "hijacks" all network traffic on the host.

.PP
\fBocproxy\fP accomplishes this by running a lwIP network stack in userland, so
the OS kernel is no longer directly handling packets sent to and from the VPN
connection.

.SH "BASIC USAGE"
.PP
\fBocproxy\fP should be invoked directly from OpenConnect or another VPN
program; a file descriptor number is passed through the \fBVPNFD\fP
environment variable to tell \fBocproxy\fP how to send and receive
VPN traffic.  For example:

.RS
openconnect \-\-script-tun \-\-script "ocproxy -D 11080 -L2222:unix-host:22"
vpn.example.com
.RE

.PP
Commonly used options include:

.TP
\fB-D, \-\-dynfw\fP \fIport\fP
Start up a SOCKS5 server on TCP port \fIport\fP to dynamically forward
application-level traffic over the VPN proxy.  This is intended to
resemble the \fB-D\fP option to \fBssh\fP(1).

.TP
\fB-L, \-\-localfw\fP \fIport:host:hostport\fP
Bind to port local TCP port \fIport\fP, and forward incoming connections
to \fIhost:hostport\fP on the VPN.  \fIhost\fP can be a DNS name or a
dotted-quad IP address.  If the VPN supplied a default DNS domain name
or \fB\-\-domain\fP was specified on the command line, unqualified hostnames
may be used.  This is intended to resemble the \fB-L\fP option to \fBssh\fP(1).

.TP
\fB-g, \-\-allow\-remote\fP
Local listening sockets opened by the \fB\-\-dynfw\fP and \fB\-\-localfw\fP
options, by default, will be bound to the loopback interface only (127.0.0.1)
so they are only available on the local machine.  If \fB\-\-allow\-remote\fP
is specified, the sockets will be bound to \fBINADDR_ANY\fP (0.0.0.0) instead,
and other hosts may connect to them.  This is intended to resemble the
\fB-g\fP option to \fBssh\fP(1).

.TP
\fB-k, \-\-keepalive\fP \fIinterval\fP
Send a TCP keepalive packet every \fIinterval\fP seconds on each open
connection, on the VPN side.  This can help avoid idle timeouts, both on
the VPN gateway and on any stateful firewalls in between the two ends.

.SH "ADVANCED USAGE"
.PP
These options may be useful for debugging \fBocproxy\fP or diagnosing problems:

.TP
\fB\-v, \-\-verbose\fP
Enable verbose debugging output.

.TP
\fB\-T, \-\-tcpdump\fP
Write a log of all TCP or UDP packets traversing the VPN to \fI/tmp/tcpdump\fP.
The format largely mirrors the output of the tcpdump(8) utility.

.PP
\fBocproxy\fP will normally retrieve IP configuration parameters through
environment variables provided by OpenConnect.  These options may be used
to override the autodetected parameters:

.TP
\fB\-I, \-\-ip\fP \fIlocal_ip\fP
Use \fIlocal_ip\fP for the VPN side IP address.  Example: 192.168.5.20.
This is normally set through the \fBINTERNAL_IP4_ADDRESS\fP environment
variable.

.TP
\fB\-M, \-\-mtu\fP \fImtu_bytes\fP
Use \fImtu_bytes\fP as the maximum transmit unit on the VPN interface; it
generally depends on DTLS and UDP packet overhead.  Example: 1300.  This is
normally set through the \fBINTERNAL_IP4_MTU\fP environment variable.

.TP
\fB\-d, \-\-dns\fP \fIdns_ip\fP
Send all VPN side DNS queries to server \fIdns_ip\fP.  Example: 192.168.5.2.
This is normally set through the \fBINTERNAL_IP4_DNS\fP environment variable.

.TP
\fB\-o, \-\-domain\fP \fIdomain\fP
Use \fIdomain\fP as the default DNS domain, for unqualified hostnames.
This is normally set through the \fBCISCO_DEF_DOMAIN\fP environment variable.
